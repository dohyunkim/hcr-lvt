Making HCR LVT fonts
====================

Scripts and feature files for making HCR LVT fonts

Hamchorom (HCR) fonts are Korean fonts bundled in Hangul Word Processor
(HWP) program, and the fonts are freely downloadable at
http://www.hancom.co.kr/downLoad.downView.do?targetRow=1&seqno=3136&mcd_save=005.

The fonts contain Old Hangul glyphs for conjoning jamo characters.
As they however do not provide relevant OpenType GSUB tables,
applications other than HWP cannot process Old Hangul characters
properly, giving only quite unpleasant results.

The purpose of this project is to add GSUB and GPOS tables to HCR fonts
for processing Old Hangul documents. Additionally, vhea and vmtx tables
will be added to support vertical writing mode. Again, 'LVT' will be
added to the family name of these fonts, so as to be distinguished from
original HCR fonts.

Building
--------

0. applications/tools needed

	* fontforge (http://github.com/fontforge/fontforge)
	* fonttools (http://github.com/behdad/fonttools)
	* perl
	* python

1. download original HCR fonts (see above) into the same directory as
   these scripts exist.

2-1. For TeX or Linux OS, run shell command as follows:

     for F in HANBatang HANBatangB HANDotum HANDotumB; \
     do make HCRTTF=$F; \
     done

2-2. For Mac OS X, run this shell command:

     for F in HANBatang HANBatangB HANDotum HANDotumB; \
     do make -f Makefile-mac HCRTTF=$F; \
     done

2-3. For Windows OS, run this shell command:

     for F in HANBatang HANBatangB HANDotum HANDotumB; \
     do make -f Makefile-win HCRTTF=$F; \
     done
